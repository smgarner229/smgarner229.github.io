<h1>Hi Hello! </h1>
<p>Quite the rabbit hole you must've gone down to find this.  Right now it's
just a skeleton single HTML document.  I intend to fully develop this webpage
into both my personal and professional webpages.</p>
<p>As I said, literally this entire repository is one single hand written HTML
file, don't expect much as of mid June 2021.  You can visit my first attempt at
a webpage <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~smgarner/ ">here</a>.  Look for
a post in the future as to why I'm at least currently utilizing github Pages.</p>
